# Boolean Auditorium

_"Shape + Structure = Form"_

This is an 8-story tall Regional Auditorium on a single lot in Oakland, CA.
The space was developed by boolean operations of three nested forms that share no
planar surfaces or coincident coordinate systems. Programs at the bottom levels are for the community.
Programs and circulations at the middle levels were divided and defined by the boolean operations, i
ncluding public (offices and visitors) and private (rehearsal, dressing rooms) programs.
Programs and circulations merge agian at the upper levels for commercial use.

_Form & Circulating Form:_

The largest shape is a Box of fixed dimensions that fills the buildable envelope.
The other two shapes intersect to occupy the middle of the first volume.
The inner shape forms the space of the auditorium. The difference between the middle and the inner shape defines circulation.
